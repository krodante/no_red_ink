# NoRedInk Code Challenge

Hi there! Thank you for taking a look at my code challenge!

The code is written in Ruby 2.0. To run this script, go to the project's root directory and run `ruby run.rb`.

You will be prompted to enter the number of questions desired. In return, you will get the question ids as an array of strings.

Thank you!
